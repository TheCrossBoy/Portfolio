						<p>Hello, and thank you so much for coming to my site! I'm thrilled to be able to share with you some of the projects I've worked on and organizations I've worked with.</p>
						<p>I've had a passion for technology and video games for as long as I can remember. When I started playing Garry's Mod, a game where any developer can come up with a multitude of extensions for the community to play with, I became incredibly immersed with the realm of game development. Over the years, I contributed to the development of multiple major communities within the game.</p>
						<p>This passion was enhanced when I participated in a course at UCSD where students have ten weeks to create a 3D multiplayer game without an engine. This was one of the greatest experiences I've been a part of, and I would love for you to read more about it on the Projects page under 'Chairiots'.</p>
						<p>In high school, I participated in the theater program, and quite enjoyed the aspect of live performance. When I got to college, this evolved into a desire to cast games that I enjoyed watching and help with the planning and execution of major student organization events for the gaming community. This fusion of my passions created a unique opportunity I was thrilled to take up.</p>
						<p>Additionally, I have worked in multiple educational spaces. I've tutored for multiple computer science courses at UCSD, including becoming the Head Tutor my final year doing so. I also did research as an undergraduate with Dr. Niema Moshiri and Dr. Tajana Rosing. This project researched COVID-19 Genome Sequencing at UCSD, and found ways to make their process more effecient to allow for better responses to the pandemic.</p>
						<p>Overall, I love finding work that I'm passionate about, and finding every way I can use what I'm good at to contribute to it. I hope you'll take a look around, and feel free to reach out to me via the buttons on the left!</p>
						Thank you!

						<p>Hello, and thank you so much for coming to my site! I'm thrilled to be able to share with you some of the projects I've worked on and organizations I've worked with.</p>
						<p>In regards to games, I've long been extremely passionate about them. I've worked on multiple game related projects, especially in relation to Garry's Mod, a game that allows for extreme customization and places an emphasis on community created content (see more details on my Projects page!).</p>
						<p>Additionally, I've worked in a multitude of educational spaces. There are two courses I've tutored for at UCSD, CSE 100 (Advanced Data Structures, which covers the basics and algorithms of many complex structures) and CSE 142L (Software Project for Computer Architecture, which involves creating optimized code and analyzing the hardware implications of various software choices).</p>
						<p>I'm also currently working on a research project with two professors advising, Niema Moshiri and Tajana Rosing. This project is looking into the COVID-19 Genome Sequencing Pipeline that analyzes COVID data from all of San Diego. Specifically, we identified that a program that takes genomic sequence reads taken from collected samples and trims them was inefficient, and I've been working on reimplementing and optimizing these algorithms to smooth this pipeline. We are currently hoping to have our program sent to a journal at some point in the future!</p>
						<p>Overall, I'm extremely passionate about Video Games, programming, software development, testing, design, analysis, and more. I do hope that you'll have a look around, and please feel free to reach out to me about anything at any of the social links at the bottom of the left side bar.</p>
						<p>Thank you!</p>
